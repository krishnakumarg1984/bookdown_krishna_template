# Methods

We describe our methods in this chapter.

This work was started on `r params$start_date` and was completed on `r params$end_date`.

```{r, fig.cap="An example of one figure environment containing multiple sub-figures.", fig.subcap=c("A boring scatterplot showing numbers from 1 to 10", "Another scatterplot for the cars data, with solid points", "A boxplot of the iris data"), fig.ncol = 2, out.width = "50%", fig.align = "center"}
plot(1:10)
plot(cars, pch = 19)
boxplot(Sepal.Width ~ Species, data = iris)
```
